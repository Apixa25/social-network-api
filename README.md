## Description üìù

[Watch a video of all the routes in action](https://apixa25.github.io/weather-dashboard/) üëÄ

This project is an API for a social network web application.  This project uses Node.js to work with the back end (the server stuff). It uses Express to configure the API routes.  Moment to display dates and times. And Mongoose to model the application data.


The routes model is interesting in that it has Users, who can have Thoughts and then users can have Reactions to those thoughts. A user can have many thoughts.  But a thought can only have one user. A user can have many reactions to many thoughts.

## Learning Points üßë‚Äçüè´

This project highlights a couple of things.  One is the difference between ORM ( which are often examples of SQL databases) and an ODM which are called No SQL database ( which in this case is a Mongo database). 

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): It is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In the context of databases, it often refers to mapping database tables to classes in an object-oriented language. The purpose is to simplify database interactions by allowing developers to work with objects in their programming language, rather than writing raw SQL queries. 

ODM (Object-Document Mapping): This term is specifically used in the context of NoSQL databases, especially for document-oriented databases like MongoDB. ODM is similar to ORM but is tailored to work with document databases where data is stored in a flexible, JSON-like format known as documents. An ODM library allows developers to interact with the database using objects in their programming language, providing a more natural way to handle documents in a NoSQL database.
